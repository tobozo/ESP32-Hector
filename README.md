# ESP32-Hector


<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobozo/ESP32-Hector/master/demo.gif>

This project is heavily inspired from the work of Gerard Ferrandez http://codepen.io/ge1doot/details/eWzQBm/
who developed and implemented a similar drawing function for HTML5 Canvas.

Sound implementation follows [@Bitluni](github.com/bitluni)'s [ULP example](https://github.com/bitluni/ULPSoundESP32/tree/master/ULPSoundMonoSample)
but is also heavily based on the Audio library from [@charlierobson](https://github.com/charlierobson/)'s [Lasertag project](https://github.com/charlierobson/lasertag/)

The sound loop is taken from "Les histoires d'amour finissent mal" by "Rita Mistouko"
and was provided by [Gardie-Le-Gueux](https://soundcloud.com/gardie-le-gueux) [Complete track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln0VwCqMkcA)
